      <description>Short intro Let us compare the performance of C++, Matlab, Python and R when performing typical econometrical/statistical tasks. The word ‘typical’ is quite ambiguous since computational requirements can vary substantially between subfields. As such, I will consider a setting that is standard yet also computationally demanding: bootstrap inference on the Durbin-Watson test statistic. This setting is easy to understand and the computational performance of the programming languages is probably representative for a wide range of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.</description>
