Current analyses frequently employ models which restrict the nonlinearities in the data to be explained by the economic growth variable only. We propose a Generalized Cointegrating Polynomial Regression (GCPR) with flexible time trends to proxy time effects such as technological progress and/or environmental awareness. More specifically, a GCPR includes flexible powers of deterministic trends and integer powers of stochastic trends. We estimate the GCPR by nonlinear least squares and derive its asymptotic distribution. Endogeneity of the regressors can introduce nuisance parameters into this limiting distribution but a simulated approach nevertheless enables us to conduct valid inference. Moreover, a subsampling KPSS test can be used to check the stationarity of the errors. A comprehensive simulation study shows good performance of the simulated inference approach and the subsampling KPSS test. We illustrate the GCPR approach on a dataset of 18 industrialised countries containing GDP and CO2 emissions. We conclude that: (1) the evidence for an EKC is significantly reduced when a nonlinear time trend is included, and (2) a linear cointegrating relation between GDP and CO2 around a power law trend also provides an accurate description of the data.","tags":null,"title":"Cointegrating Polynomial Regressions with Power Law Trends: A New Angle on the Environmental Kuznets Curve","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yicong Lin and Hanno Reuvers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590962400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590962400,"objectID":"94432b662be6869e43e108049167b776","permalink":"https://HannoReuvers.github.io/publication/ekc-paper/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ekc-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper develops the asymptotic theory of a Fully Modified Generalized Least Squares estimator for multivariate cointegrating polynomial regressions.

Ethane is also an indirect greenhouse gas (global warming potential), influencing the atmospheric lifetime of methane through the consumption of the hydroxyl radical (OH). Understanding the development of trends and identifying trend reversals in atmospheric ethane is therefore crucial. Our dataset consists of four series of daily ethane columns. As with many other decadal time series, our data are characterized by autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity, and seasonal effects. Additionally, missing observations due to instrument failure or unfavorable measurement conditions are common in such series. The goal of this paper is therefore to analyze trends in atmospheric ethane with statistical tools that correctly address these data features. We present selected methods designed for the analysis of time trends and trend reversals. We consider bootstrap inference on broken linear trends and smoothly varying nonlinear trends. In particular, for the broken trend model, we propose a bootstrap method for inference on the break location and the corresponding changes in slope. For the smooth trend model we construct simultaneous confidence bands around the nonparametrically estimated trend. Our autoregressive wild bootstrap approach, combined with a seasonal filter, is able to handle all issues mentioned above.","tags":null,"title":"A Statistical Analysis of Time Trends in Atmospheric Ethane","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Lohmeyer, Franz Palm, Hanno Reuvers, and Jean-Pierre Urbain"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548975600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548975600,"objectID":"787f64717bdb93c7ad157f67a2916977","permalink":"https://HannoReuvers.github.io/publication/fic-paper/","publishdate":"2019-02-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fic-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper investigates the focused information criterion and plug-in average for vector autoregressive models with local-to-zero misspecification.

The word ‘typical’ is quite ambiguous since computational requirements can vary substantially between subfields. As such, I will consider a setting that is standard yet also computationally demanding: bootstrap inference on the Durbin-Watson test statistic. This setting is easy to understand and the computational performance of the programming languages is probably representative for a wide range of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. MC simulations are very often needed in research when relying on frequentist statistics.\nThe Durbin-Watson test statistic Consider a standard multivariate regression model $y_t^{} = \\mathbf{x}_t\u0026rsquo; \\boldsymbol \\beta + u_t^{}$ for $t = 1, 2, . . . , T$. The presence of serial correlation in $u_t$ will render standard ordinary least squares (OLS) inference invalid. The Durbin-Watson test statistic was one of the first test statistics to test for the presence of serial correlation.1 It is computed as follows:\n Calculate the OLS estimator $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\beta}=(\\mathbf{X}'\\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}'\\mathbf{y}$. Obtain the residuals $\\widehat{u}_t=y_t- \\mathbf{x}_t\u0026rsquo;\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\beta}$ for $t = 1, 2, . . . , T$. The Durbin-Watson test statisic is now computed as $DW= \\frac{\\sum_{t=2}^T \\left(\\widehat{u}_t-\\widehat{u}_{t-1}\\right)^2 }{\\sum_{t=1}^T \\widehat{u}_t^2}$.  Simple algebraic manipulations show that the Durbin-Watson statistic can be expressed in terms of the first order sample autocorrelation $\\widehat{\\rho}= \\frac{\\sum_{t=2}^T \\widehat{u}_t\\widehat{u}_{t-1} }{\\sum_{t=1}^T \\widehat{u}_t^2}$, namely $DW=2(1-\\widehat{\\rho})-\\frac{\\widehat{u}_1^2+\\widehat{u}_T^2}{\\sum_{t=1}^T \\widehat{u}_t^2}$. Based on this result we would expect outcomes close to the value 2 if first order autocorrelation is absent. Values different from 2 indicate serial correlation. Using the Durbin-Watson statistic to carry out a formal hypothesis test is more complicated because its (asymptotic) distribution is difficult to derive. This motivates the use of a bootstrap approach.2 The specific steps are:\n Estimate $\\boldsymbol \\beta$ by OLS and compute the residual series ${\\widehat{u}_t }$ as well as the Durbin-Watson statistic $DW$. Compute $\\widehat{\\rho}$ (see the definition above) and $\\widehat{\\varepsilon,}_t=\\widehat{u}_t- \\widehat{\\rho} \\widehat{u}_{t-1}$ for $t=2,3,\\ldots,T$. Draw bootstrap errors $\\varepsilon_t^\\star$ by resampling with replacement from $\\{\\widehat{\\varepsilon}_2,\\widehat{\\varepsilon,}_3,\\ldots,\\widehat{\\varepsilon,}_T \\}$. Store these in the vector $\\boldsymbol \\varepsilon^\\star=[\\varepsilon_1^\\star,\\varepsilon_2^\\star,\\ldots,\\varepsilon_T^\\star]\u0026rsquo; $. Set $\\mathbf{u}^\\star=\\boldsymbol \\varepsilon^\\star$ (to impose the null hypothesis in the bootstrap sample), construct the bootstrap sample $\\mathbf{y}^\\star=\\mathbf{X}\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\beta}+\\mathbf{u}^\\star$, and compute the DW statistic from $\\mathbf{y}^\\star$. Repeat steps 3-4 $B$ times and store these outcomes in a list $\\left\\{ DW_b^\\star \\right\\}_{b=1}^B$. For a given significance level $\\alpha$, we define $q_{\\alpha/2}^\\star$ and $q_{1-\\alpha/2}^\\star$ as the $\\alpha/2$ and $1-\\alpha/2$ empirical quantiles of $\\left\\{ DW_b^\\star \\right\\}_{b=1}^B$. We reject the null hypothesis of no serial correlation if either $DW \u0026lt; q_{\\alpha/2}^\\star$ or if $DW\u0026gt;q_{1-\\alpha/2}^\\star$.  The simulation setting We consider a simple simulation setting to compare the different programming environments, namely\n$$ \\begin{aligned} y_t \u0026amp;= \\mathbf{x}_t\u0026rsquo;\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+u_t \\\\\\\nu_t \u0026amp;= \\rho u_{t-1}+\\varepsilon_t, \\qquad \\qquad t=1,2,\\ldots,T, \\end{aligned} $$\nwhere $T=\\{100,250,500\\}$. The fixed regressor matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ contains a column of ones and a column that repeats the sequence $0,1,0,-1$ (orthogonal design). The error terms ${\\epsilon_t}$ are standard normal and a presample of 50 observations is used to remove the influence of the initial values. We set $\\boldsymbol \\beta=[1,2]\u0026rsquo; $ and vary the value for $\\rho$ over the grid $[0,0.025,\\ldots,0.5]\u0026rsquo; $ (21 grid points). The resulting power curves are depicted in Figure 1. Overall, we use 1000 Monte Carlo replications where each replication uses $B=499$ bootstrap resamples.\nResults and discussion Simulations are performed on a Macbook with a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5 processor. I used serial computing. The computational times are reported in Table 1.\n   Table 1: Absolute and relative (using C++ as the benchmark) computational times in seconds.   The conclusions from this table are unambiguous. The C++ implementation is significantly faster than the scientific programming environments of Matlab and R. However, this should be balanced against the fact that the programming itself is much easier/faster in the user-friendly environments offered by either of these languages. The results do not promote the use of Python. The computational times are longest and coding is less comfortable because matrix algebra requires an additional library (such as numpy). My conclusions are qualitatively the same as those in Borağan Aruoba and Fernández-Villaverde (2015).3\nReferences   J. Durbin and G. S.
