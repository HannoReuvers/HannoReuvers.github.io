Current analyses frequently employ models which restrict the nonlinearities in the data to be explained by the economic growth variable only. We propose a Generalized Cointegrating Polynomial Regression (GCPR) with flexible time trends to proxy time effects such as technological progress and/or environmental awareness. More specifically, a GCPR includes flexible powers of deterministic trends and integer powers of stochastic trends. We estimate the GCPR by nonlinear least squares and derive its asymptotic distribution. Endogeneity of the regressors can introduce nuisance parameters into this limiting distribution but a simulated approach nevertheless enables us to conduct valid inference. Moreover, a subsampling KPSS test can be used to check the stationarity of the errors. A comprehensive simulation study shows good performance of the simulated inference approach and the subsampling KPSS test. We illustrate the GCPR approach on a dataset of 18 industrialised countries containing GDP and CO2 emissions. We conclude that: (1) the evidence for an EKC is significantly reduced when a nonlinear time trend is included, and (2) a linear cointegrating relation between GDP and CO2 around a power law trend also provides an accurate description of the data.","tags":null,"title":"Cointegrating Polynomial Regressions with Power Law Trends: A New Angle on the Environmental Kuznets Curve","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yicong Lin and Hanno Reuvers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590962400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590962400,"objectID":"94432b662be6869e43e108049167b776","permalink":"https://HannoReuvers.github.io/publication/ekc-paper/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ekc-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper develops the asymptotic theory of a Fully Modified Generalized Least Squares estimator for multivariate cointegrating polynomial regressions.

Understanding the development of trends and identifying trend reversals in atmospheric ethane is therefore crucial. Our dataset consists of four series of daily ethane columns. As with many other decadal time series, our data are characterized by autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity, and seasonal effects. Additionally, missing observations due to instrument failure or unfavorable measurement conditions are common in such series. The goal of this paper is therefore to analyze trends in atmospheric ethane with statistical tools that correctly address these data features. We present selected methods designed for the analysis of time trends and trend reversals. We consider bootstrap inference on broken linear trends and smoothly varying nonlinear trends. In particular, for the broken trend model, we propose a bootstrap method for inference on the break location and the corresponding changes in slope. For the smooth trend model we construct simultaneous confidence bands around the nonparametrically estimated trend.

Two key players are displayed in Figure 1. We see how both the global temperature and the global carbon dioxide1 ($\\text{CO}_2$) concentration have been rising steadily over the last 40 years. The connection between these two graphs is commonly known as the \u0026ldquo;greenhouse effect\u0026rdquo;.\n   Figure 1: Yearly temperature anomalies and carbon dioxide concentrations for the time period 1980-2019. (a) The temperature anomaly is the temperature difference with respect to the 1951-1980 global average (source: https://climate.nasa.gov) . (b) Global $\\text{CO}_2$ concentrations as obtained from NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory.   How exactly are these tiny $\\text{CO}_2$ molecules affecting the temperature on earth? The answer to this question is the topic of this post. We will look at two models: the bare-rock model and the layer model.2 Both models should be viewed as toy models as they describe a very much simplified version of reality. Indeed, the earth will be treated as a perfect sphere with the same temperature everywhere. All difficult heat flows and spatial variation on our planet, e.g. ocean currents and altitude differences, are simply ignored. Notwithstanding their simplicity, these models will still provide all necessary ingredients to fully understand the greenhouse effect.\nThe bare-rock model The bare-rock model is a stylized model to explain the temperature on earth. This earth is represented by a large ball and its temperature is assumed to be the same everywhere. An energy balance between incoming sunlight and heat loss to space determines the temperature on our planet.\nEnergy received by the earth When taking a walk on a beautiful summer day, you will feel the warmth of the sun. Similarly, the earth is continuously heated by the sun. How much energy is our spherical earth receiving from the sun? Let $I_{sun}$ denote the energy influx of sunlight, i.e. the amount of incoming energy per second and per $\\text{m}^2$. To calculate the amount of energy absorbed per second, we have to multiply $I_{sun}$ by the area of the earth which is absorbing sunlight. An inspection of Figure 2 shows that the relevant area equals $\\pi r_{earth}^2$. We additionally have to account for the fact that snow, ice, and clouds will reflect a fraction of the incoming sunlight back to space. This fraction is called the albedo and is generally denoted by $\\alpha$. If a fraction $\\alpha$ is reflected, then there remains a fraction $1-\\alpha$ to be absorbed. Overall, the effective incoming flux of solar energy is: \\begin{equation} \\label{eq1} F_{in} [\\text{Watt}]= I_{sun} \\times \\pi r_{earth}^2 \\times (1-\\alpha). \\end{equation} The units of this energy flux is Watt (also abbreviated by W).3\n   Figure 2: The earth will leave a circular shadow on a screen placed behind it. The area of this circle is $\\pi r_{earth}^2$, where $r_{earth}^{}$ is the radius of our spherical planet.   Emitted energy The earth is not only absorbing energy, it is also emitting energy. The emitted energy is in the form of so-called black-body radiation. All warm objects emit this type of radiation and both the dominant wavelengths of the emitted light and the total energy flux depend on the body's temperature. Warmer objects emit radiation of shorter wavelength. This explains why we see a shining sun and a glow on the iron that has just been taken out of the fire. Our earth is much colder than either of these objects and is thus radiating light of much longer wavelength. These wavelenghts are too long for the human eye to observe.\nOf particular interest for our bare-rock model is the energy flux from a black-body radiator. The amount of energy emitted per second and per $\\text{m}^2$ is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: \\begin{equation} I_{black\\text{ }body} = \\sigma T^4, \\end{equation} where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (a constant of nature) and $T$ denotes the temperature in Kelvins.4 Each square meter of surface area can emit black-body radiation. Given that the total surface area of the earth is $4 \\pi r_{Earth}^2$, the outgoing energy flux of our planet is \\begin{equation} F_{out} [\\text{Watt}] = \\sigma T^4\\times 4 \\pi r_{earth}^2. \\end{equation}\nFinding a balance\u0026hellip; Depending on the magnitudes of $F_{in}$ and $F_{out}$, we find ourselves in one of the following three situations:\n $F_{in} \u0026gt; F_{out}$: The earth is receiving more energy than it is sending back to space. The accumulation of energy will cause the earth to heat up. $F_{in} \u0026lt; F_{out}$: The nett heat flux is negative, that is, our spherical earth is steadily losing energy and hence cooling down. $F_{in} = F_{out}$: The incoming and outgoing energy flux are exactly equal. There is neither heat gain nor heat loss and the temperature will remain constant.  If $F_{in} = F_{out}$, then our earth is in equilibrium \u0026ndash; or in steady-state \u0026ndash; and this provides a good indication of the earth's temperature according to our bare-rock model. Inserting the expressions for $F_{in}$ and $F_{out}$, this equilibrium temperature turns out to be: $$ T_{equilibrium} = \\left( \\frac{ (1-\\alpha) I_{sun}}{4 \\sigma} \\right)^{1/4}. $$ If we plug in some representative numbers,5 then this ball-shaped earth will have an equilibrium temperature of 254 K (or -19 $^\\circ$C). This earth is too cold, we better add a blanket!\n   Figure 3: A schematic representation of the layer model. Sunlight shines unhindered through the layer and warms the earth. The radiation from the earth is trapped by the layer and re-emitted towards both the earth and the universe.   The layer model Our blanket is an additional layer placed between the earth and the sun, see Figure 3. This layer is special. The incoming light from the sun will pass straight through it, but the outgoing radiation from the earth is absorbed and subsequently re-emitted. Our new task is to determine the resulting equilibrium temperature of the earth. We again match the incoming and outgoing energy fluxes but now we should do so for the earth and the layer simulaneously. Additionally, we set the sun's energy flux per unit of area equal to $I_{sunlight}= \\frac{1}{4} (1-\\alpha) I_{sun}$.6 The equilibrium equations are $$ I_{sunlight} + I_{layer,down} = I_{earth} \\iff \\frac{1}{4} (1-\\alpha) I_{sun} + \\sigma T_{layer}^4 = \\sigma T_{earth}^4 $$ and $$ I_{earth} = I_{layer,up} + I_{layer,down} \\iff \\sigma T_{earth}^4 = \\sigma T_{layer}^4 + \\sigma T_{layer}^4 $$ for the earth and layer, respectively. We can solve these two equations and find the earth's temperature in this layer model: $$ T_{earth} = \\left( \\frac{ 2 (1-\\alpha) I_{sun}}{4 \\sigma} \\right)^{1/4}. $$ A quick comparison with $T_{equilibrium}$ shows that the new temperature $T_{earth}$ is a factor $2^{1/4}\\approx 1.1892$ higher. The new temperature on earth is now 302 K (or about 29 $^\\circ$C). The current temperature is probably a bit too high but we will see that $\\text{CO}_2$ is not behaving as extreme as our layer. That is, this greenhouse gas does not absorb all the radiation coming from earth. Most importantly, we can now understand why the additional layer works as a blanket. It creates an additional energy flow $I_{layer,down}$ back to earth that causes the earth to warm up.\nThe analogy between carbon dioxide and the layer Carbon dioxide behaves similarly to our layer. The incoming sunlight from our warm sun has a relatively short wavelenght and this light will not (or hardly) interact with the $\\text{CO}_2$ molecules in the air. As the earth is much colder than the sun, it will emit black body radiation with longer wavelength. This radiation is partly(!) absorbed by the carbon dioxide molecules in the air and released into any arbitrary direction. This process creates an energy flow back to earth much the same as $I_{layer,down}$ in Figure 3. The higher the $\\text{CO}_2$ concentration in the atmosphere, the more energy is channeled back to earth, and the more global warming. Finally, do note that there is nothing special about carbon dioxide. The warming mechanism behind the other greenhouse gasses is the same!\nNotes   Of course, there are also other greenhouse gasses (e.g. water vapor, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone). Feel free to read \u0026ldquo;greenhouse gasses\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;carbon dioxide\u0026rdquo; throughout this post. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The discussions of the bare-rock and layer model are inspired by chapters 2-4 from Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast by David Archer. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 1 Watt is equal to 1 Joule per second. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n It is easy to convert a temperature from degree Celsius to Kelvin, just add 273.15.

The word ‘typical’ is quite ambiguous since computational requirements can vary substantially between subfields. As such, I will consider a setting that is standard yet also computationally demanding: bootstrap inference on the Durbin-Watson test statistic. This setting is easy to understand and the computational performance of the programming languages is probably representative for a wide range of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. MC simulations are very often needed in research when relying on frequentist statistics.\nThe Durbin-Watson test statistic Consider a standard multivariate regression model $y_t^{} = \\mathbf{x}_t\u0026rsquo; \\boldsymbol \\beta + u_t^{}$ for $t = 1, 2, . . . , T$. The presence of serial correlation in $u_t$ will render standard ordinary least squares (OLS) inference invalid. The Durbin-Watson test statistic was one of the first test statistics to test for the presence of serial correlation.1 It is computed as follows:\n Calculate the OLS estimator $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\beta}=(\\mathbf{X}'\\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}'\\mathbf{y}$. Obtain the residuals $\\widehat{u}_t=y_t- \\mathbf{x}_t\u0026rsquo;\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\beta}$ for $t = 1, 2, . . . , T$. The Durbin-Watson test statisic is now computed as $DW= \\frac{\\sum_{t=2}^T \\left(\\widehat{u}_t-\\widehat{u}_{t-1}\\right)^2 }{\\sum_{t=1}^T \\widehat{u}_t^2}$.  Simple algebraic manipulations show that the Durbin-Watson statistic can be expressed in terms of the first order sample autocorrelation $\\widehat{\\rho}= \\frac{\\sum_{t=2}^T \\widehat{u}_t\\widehat{u}_{t-1} }{\\sum_{t=1}^T \\widehat{u}_t^2}$, namely $DW=2(1-\\widehat{\\rho})-\\frac{\\widehat{u}_1^2+\\widehat{u}_T^2}{\\sum_{t=1}^T \\widehat{u}_t^2}$. Based on this result we would expect outcomes close to the value 2 if first order autocorrelation is absent. Values different from 2 indicate serial correlation. Using the Durbin-Watson statistic to carry out a formal hypothesis test is more complicated because its (asymptotic) distribution is difficult to derive. This motivates the use of a bootstrap approach.2 The specific steps are:\n Estimate $\\boldsymbol \\beta$ by OLS and compute the residual series ${\\widehat{u}_t }$ as well as the Durbin-Watson statistic $DW$. Compute $\\widehat{\\rho}$ (see the definition above) and $\\widehat{\\varepsilon,}_t=\\widehat{u}_t- \\widehat{\\rho} \\widehat{u}_{t-1}$ for $t=2,3,\\ldots,T$. Draw bootstrap errors $\\varepsilon_t^\\star$ by resampling with replacement from $\\{\\widehat{\\varepsilon}_2,\\widehat{\\varepsilon,}_3,\\ldots,\\widehat{\\varepsilon,}_T \\}$. Store these in the vector $\\boldsymbol \\varepsilon^\\star=[\\varepsilon_1^\\star,\\varepsilon_2^\\star,\\ldots,\\varepsilon_T^\\star]\u0026rsquo; $. Set $\\mathbf{u}^\\star=\\boldsymbol \\varepsilon^\\star$ (to impose the null hypothesis in the bootstrap sample), construct the bootstrap sample $\\mathbf{y}^\\star=\\mathbf{X}\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\beta}+\\mathbf{u}^\\star$, and compute the DW statistic from $\\mathbf{y}^\\star$. Repeat steps 3-4 $B$ times and store these outcomes in a list $\\left\\{ DW_b^\\star \\right\\}_{b=1}^B$. For a given significance level $\\alpha$, we define $q_{\\alpha/2}^\\star$ and $q_{1-\\alpha/2}^\\star$ as the $\\alpha/2$ and $1-\\alpha/2$ empirical quantiles of $\\left\\{ DW_b^\\star \\right\\}_{b=1}^B$. We reject the null hypothesis of no serial correlation if either $DW \u0026lt; q_{\\alpha/2}^\\star$ or if $DW\u0026gt;q_{1-\\alpha/2}^\\star$.  The simulation setting We consider a simple simulation setting to compare the different programming environments, namely\n$$ \\begin{aligned} y_t \u0026amp;= \\mathbf{x}_t\u0026rsquo;\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+u_t \\\\\\\nu_t \u0026amp;= \\rho u_{t-1}+\\varepsilon_t, \\qquad \\qquad t=1,2,\\ldots,T, \\end{aligned} $$\nwhere $T=\\{100,250,500\\}$. The fixed regressor matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ contains a column of ones and a column that repeats the sequence $0,1,0,-1$ (orthogonal design). The error terms ${\\epsilon_t}$ are standard normal and a presample of 50 observations is used to remove the influence of the initial values. We set $\\boldsymbol \\beta=[1,2]\u0026rsquo; $ and vary the value for $\\rho$ over the grid $[0,0.025,\\ldots,0.5]\u0026rsquo; $ (21 grid points). The resulting power curves are depicted in Figure 1. Overall, we use 1000 Monte Carlo replications where each replication uses $B=499$ bootstrap resamples.\nResults and discussion Simulations are performed on a Macbook with a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5 processor. I used serial computing. The computational times are reported in Table 1.\n   Table 1: Absolute and relative (using C++ as the benchmark) computational times in seconds.   The conclusions from this table are unambiguous. The C++ implementation is significantly faster than the scientific programming environments of Matlab and R. However, this should be balanced against the fact that the programming itself is much easier/faster in the user-friendly environments offered by either of these languages. The results do not promote the use of Python. The computational times are longest and coding is less comfortable because matrix algebra requires an additional library (such as numpy). My conclusions are qualitatively the same as those in Borağan Aruoba and Fernández-Villaverde (2015).3\nReferences   J. Durbin and G. S.
